# How to use

- Clone the Repository:
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. You can use a Git client or the git clone command in the terminal.

- Move Files to 'htdocs':
Move or copy the contents of the cloned repository to the 'htdocs' folder within your XAMPP installation directory. This is the folder where XAMPP looks for files to serve.

- Access via Web Browser:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/your_project_folder (replace 'your_project_folder' with the actual folder name inside 'htdocs' where your project is).

- XAMPP Control Panel:
Use the XAMPP Control Panel to start Apache. This allows your local server to serve the web pages from the 'htdocs' directory.

- 'admin' in Apache Row:
Clicking on 'admin' in the Apache row might take you to the Apache administration page, which can be useful for configuring your server. However, this step is optional for basic usage.
